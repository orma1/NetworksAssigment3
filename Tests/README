# Tests
## User interface
 - 1 We need to check if the client can load a file from the config and to pass it to the Server
 - 2 We need to check if the client chooses manual input, the client will be able to send packtes
   that he enters manually and the connection wont be closed untill he closes the CLI with a key press
## Client:
 - We want to make sure that the client starts with Three Way Handshake
 - Then the client asks for the server max_msg_size and is "DynamicSize" acitvated
 - We want to make sure that in case the bool FLAG "DynamicSize" is True that we recive in every ACK the max_msg_size with non negative size
 - We want to make sure that if case the bool FLAG "DynamicSize" is False we send PSH request for max_msg_size and recive it during ACK
 - Make sure that the SEQ numbers are right
## Client SlidingWindow
 - We need to check that on recive of a new DynamicSize we will recalculate the messages in sliding window
 - We need to make sure we contain a pointer to the oldest packet that we haven't recived an ACK to her yet, in case of a timeout
 - We need to check if the window slides only upon reciving an ACK, and slides according to GO-BACK-N algorithm (Altough the we use a hybrid of a sliding window)
## Client Timeouts:
 - We need to make sure that if we send all the sequences, we resend all the packets (according to the size of the sliding window) from the oldets packet.
## Client FIN:
 - We need to make sure that when we are done sending packets enitely. The client will be the side who initializes the FIN first and gets and ACK back, 
   then he waits for the Server to have its own FIN and Client responds with ACK.

## Server
 - Make sure he reads the inputs from the config that initialize the max_messgae_size, dynamic message size boolean
 - Make sure he buffers a seq packets that came out of order
 - Make sure he drops the messages that are too big and send a new updated ACK
 - Make sure that he updateds the max_message_size when DynamicSize bool is True
 - Make sure the server buffer is being flashed when the size changes
 - Make sure the server drops the packets too big
 - Make sure the server resends the right ACK number
 - Make sure the server FIN only after the client
